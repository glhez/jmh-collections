# JMH Collection [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/glhez/jmh-collections.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/glhez/jmh-collections)

A collection of JMH benchmark that I wanted to do, after reading question on StackOverflow (why not?).

Test is split per JDK, with a code duplication (heck) and specialization (eg: using new JDK feature) to ensure same code is compiled under the target JDK.
